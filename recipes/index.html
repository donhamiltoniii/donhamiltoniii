                            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C.</li>
                            <li>Using a fork, pierce holes along one side of the spaghetti squash.</li>
                            <li>Microwave the squash for 5 minutes to make it easier to cut open.</li>
                            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut the squash in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a spoon.</li>

                            <li>After the mixture is heated through, toss in the cherry tomatoes and give the pan one last toss to help everything come together.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat and serve.</li>

                            <li>1 large spaghetti squash</li>

                            <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F/190˚C.</li>
                            <li>With a sharp knife, slice the squash in half. (If the squash is too tough - puncture in several places forming a dotted line around the squash. Microwave 3-5 minutes to soften. Allow to cool before cutting in half - following the dotted line).</li>
                            <li>Scoop out the seeds, brush with oil, salt, and pepper, and place face down on a baking tray.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a fork can easily pierce the skin.</li>
                            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan. Add chicken breasts (seasoned with salt and pepper) and garlic, and fully cook.</li>
                            <li>Add tomatoes and spinach. Cook until spinach has wilted.</li>
                            <li>Add marinara sauce, basil, and crushed red pepper, and stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Once the squash has finished roasting, remove from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes before turning over and pulling at it with a fork. (Careful, there will be some steam!)</li>
                            <li>Shred the inside of each squash, being careful not to poke through the skin. Pour the sauce over the shredded squash, top with fresh basil, and serve.</li>
                            <li>Enjoy!</li>
